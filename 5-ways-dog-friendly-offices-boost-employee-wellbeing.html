                <p><strong>Dog-friendly offices can reduce stress, improve productivity, and strengthen team connections.</strong> Here's how:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower Stress:</strong> Dogs help lower cortisol levels and increase oxytocin, making workplaces calmer and more enjoyable.</li>
                <li><strong>More Movement:</strong> Employees are more likely to take breaks and stay active, improving overall health.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Team Connection:</strong> Pets encourage casual interactions, helping coworkers bond.</li>
                <li><strong>Easier Work-Life Balance:</strong> Bringing dogs to work reduces pet care stress and costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Higher Team Spirit:</strong> Happier employees feel more engaged and productive.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Research shows 90% of employees in pet-friendly workplaces feel connected to their company's mission, and 44% of dog owners would reject jobs without these policies.</p>

                <p>Research from <a href="https://www.vcu.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Commonwealth University</a> shows that having dogs at work can help reduce stress. Employees with dogs experience lower stress levels, while those without dogs tend to see their stress increase over the day <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17538351211215366/full/html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>To study this, researchers analyzed stress hormone levels using saliva samples. They compared three groups: employees who brought their dogs to work (DOG group), employees who left their dogs at home (NODOG group), and employees without pets (NOPET group) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-17561272" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. While all groups started the day with similar stress levels, differences emerged as the day went on.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;The differences in perceived stress between days the dog was present and absent were significant. The employees as a whole had higher job satisfaction than industry norms&quot;, says Randolph Barker, lead study author and professor of management at the VCU School of Business <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-17561272" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The science behind this is simple. Marie-Jos√© Enders from Open University explains, &quot;Not only does your cortisol level drop when you stroke a dog; you also produce more of the hormone oxytocin, which makes you feel more relaxed and happy&quot; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/office-cats-and-dogs-reduce-stress-levels-and-boost-productivity-2018-12" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. These biological changes can lead to a more relaxed and productive workplace.</p>
                <p>At TVMC, a video marketing company, their office Labradoodle Joep provides a perfect example. Esther Jonker from TVMC shares, &quot;When we've been very busy working on something, it's nice to play with Joep. I think it makes us more productive&quot; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/office-cats-and-dogs-reduce-stress-levels-and-boost-productivity-2018-12" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. Even just having a dog nearby helps keep cortisol levels lower throughout the day, benefiting everyone in the office <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/office-cats-and-dogs-reduce-stress-levels-and-boost-productivity-2018-12" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>At <a href="https://lyallbayworkhub.nz/">Lyall Bay WorkHub</a>, the beachside location adds another layer of stress relief. Employees can take quick walks by the ocean to reset and recharge.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, when dog owners leave their pets at home, their stress levels are similar to those who don‚Äôt own dogs at all <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17538351211215366/full/html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. This highlights the value of consistent dog-friendly policies for reducing workplace stress.</p>
                <h2 id="2-more-daily-movement" tabindex="-1">2. More Daily Movement</h2>
                <p>Having dogs in the office encourages employees to move more throughout the day. Studies show that dog owners are 34% more likely to hit the recommended 150 minutes of walking each week <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. This pattern is noticeable in many workplaces.</p>
                <p>Take <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/how-much-does-amazon-love-dogs-just-ask-one-of-the-8-000-pups-that-work-here" target="_blank">Amazon</a>'s Dogs at Work program as an example. With over 10,000 registered dogs in more than 100 offices <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/how-much-does-amazon-love-dogs-just-ask-one-of-the-8-000-pups-that-work-here" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, employees are naturally motivated to take short walks and play breaks. These moments not only break up long stretches of sitting but also help boost energy levels.</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;Taking a break to cuddle with the office furball or stroll with a pup can recharge our batteries and get those creative juices flowing as well&quot; <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Walking regularly has proven health benefits, such as improving heart health and reducing blood pressure <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. At Lyall Bay WorkHub, the office‚Äôs beachside location makes it easy for employees to enjoy brisk walks with their dogs while soaking in ocean views.</p>
                <p>Plus, 93% of dog owners believe pet-friendly workplaces improve their attitude toward coming to work <a href="https://www.workdesign.com/2024/02/the-power-of-pet-friendly-workplaces/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. These dog-inspired breaks fit naturally into the workday, giving both employees and their pets a chance to recharge and refresh.</p>
                <h6 id="sbb-itb-a772226" tabindex="-1">sbb-itb-a772226</h6>
                <h2 id="3-better-team-connection" tabindex="-1">3. Better Team Connection</h2>
                <p>Dogs can help strengthen workplace relationships and encourage genuine connections among coworkers. They don't just reduce stress and get people moving - they also play a role in bringing colleagues together. For example, at Amazon, many participants in the Dogs at Work program have noted that their pets help them meet more people around the office <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/how-much-does-amazon-love-dogs-just-ask-one-of-the-8-000-pups-that-work-here" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>Having dogs in the office naturally creates chances for interaction. When employees take a moment to pet or play with a dog, these casual breaks often lead to conversations that might not happen otherwise. Plus, spending time with dogs can trigger the release of oxytocin and lower cortisol levels, which helps build bonds and creates a more relaxed, welcoming environment where coworkers feel at ease engaging with one another <a href="https://butternutbox.com/blog/benefits-of-office-dogs" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>At Lyall Bay WorkHub, the dog-friendly setup encourages these kinds of positive interactions. Shared spaces like the large kitchen and communal areas become natural gathering spots where employees can chat while their dogs mingle. These spontaneous moments often translate into better collaboration and communication across teams.</p>
                <p>To ensure dogs contribute positively to workplace dynamics while maintaining professionalism, dog-friendly offices often implement clear guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Zones</strong>: Designate specific areas where dogs and their owners can interact without interrupting work.</li>
                <li><strong>Planned Activities</strong>: Host regular dog-friendly events to bring teams together.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Amenities</strong>: Offer essentials like water bowls and cozy spaces for dogs to rest.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These thoughtful measures help dogs contribute to stronger team connections, improved communication, and a collaborative workplace atmosphere - all while keeping the office environment professional and productive.</p>
                <h2 id="4-easier-work-life-balance" tabindex="-1">4. Easier Work-Life Balance</h2>
                <p>Dog-friendly policies do more than just bring teams together - they make juggling work and personal responsibilities simpler. These policies provide practical solutions for pet owners, cutting down on stress and extra costs.</p>
                <p>Emma Hendry, People Experience Managing Director for <a href="https://www.us.jll.com/en/solutions/workplace-strategy" target="_blank">JLL Consulting</a>, highlights this point:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;There are practical benefits for dog owners, like not having to check the dog camera to see if things are ok back home, or pay a dog sitter&quot; <a href="https://www.jll.ca/en/trends-and-insights/workplace/why-more-companies-are-opening-office-doors-to-dogs" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>By allowing employees to bring their dogs to work, companies eliminate the need for remote pet monitoring or hiring dog sitters. Spaces like Lyall Bay WorkHub take this a step further. With its beachside location and pet-friendly amenities, workers can care for their pets without interrupting their workday. Features like a spacious kitchen and outdoor areas make it easy to manage pet needs while sticking to a regular schedule.</p>
                <p>To ensure productivity while reaping these benefits, some simple arrangements can help:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Plan Meetings Wisely</strong>: Schedule meetings during your pet's nap times.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Pet-Friendly Zones</strong>: Designate specific areas for pet breaks and meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Support</strong>: Coordinate with coworkers to watch over pets during important meetings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hendry also notes a growing trend:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;Many dog owners are now realizing a dog is for life, not just for Covid-19. So I'd expect to see more companies include a range of dog policies in their workplace strategies&quot; <a href="https://www.jll.ca/en/trends-and-insights/workplace/why-more-companies-are-opening-office-doors-to-dogs" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2 id="5-higher-team-spirit" tabindex="-1">5. Higher Team Spirit</h2>
                <p>Dogs can uplift team morale and boost productivity. Research shows that pet-friendly offices often see better workplace dynamics, with 91% of employees reporting higher engagement and 67% noting improved productivity <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>At Flick Electric Co. in Wellington, the presence of dogs has a noticeable impact on workplace spirit. Software developer Paul Brabet explains:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;It adds to your productivity because you're happier&quot; <a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/partner/30-01-2020/canine-to-five-why-every-office-should-be-a-dog-office" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Happier employees often lead to better results. Dog-friendly workplaces report:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>22% higher satisfaction</strong> with working conditions</li>
                <li><strong>33% increased focus</strong> on tasks</li>
                <li><strong>16% greater dedication</strong> to responsibilities <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This type of environment not only builds stronger connections among colleagues but also fosters a sense of team unity. For example, at a motorcycle parts business in Western Australia, owner Graeme Olsen shares:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;Every time a customer comes in, the dogs walk straight up, wagging their tail. I can't think of any customer who hasn't smiled and sat down and patted the dog&quot; <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/dogs-bringing-joy-and-comfort-to-workplaces/11691654" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In Newcastle, an archaeologist‚Äôs office benefits from having Milo, a border collie, on-site. Morgan Wilcox highlights:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;He's got that therapy dog ability to be very calm. He picks the person he can tell needs a bit of extra comfort. The vibe in the office is different when he's around - everyone's just a bit more relaxed and playful&quot; <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/everyday/dogs-bringing-joy-and-comfort-to-workplaces/11691654" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The positive effects of such policies extend beyond morale. Businesses with dog-friendly environments report a <strong>17% increase in productivity</strong> <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/workplaces-with-dogs-boost-productivity-by-17-study-reveals-1034063990" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. Additionally, 90% of employees in these workplaces feel deeply connected to their company‚Äôs mission and are more likely to recommend their employer <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
                <p>At Lyall Bay WorkHub, a beachside coworking space, these benefits shine through. Open communal spaces, like the large kitchen, encourage spontaneous collaboration, with pets helping to break down barriers between team members.</p>
                <p>Mateusz Barczyk of <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Hushoffice</a> explains:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;Having a dog in the office can spark conversations and bring colleagues together regardless of their position or hierarchy. It creates a shared interest that fosters natural connection and makes it easier for people to interact&quot; <a href="https://hushoffice.com/en-us/pet-friendly-offices-boast-serious-benefits/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Allowing dogs in the workplace can significantly enhance employee wellbeing in several ways. Research shows that companies with pet-friendly policies often experience noticeable improvements in workplace dynamics and employee satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and increase oxytocin, which translates to greater job satisfaction and reduced absenteeism <a href="https://butternutbox.com/blog/benefits-of-office-dogs" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[9]</sup></a>. These biological effects help explain the positive shift in workplace culture observed in such environments.</p>
                <p>At Lyall Bay WorkHub, the beachside location and thoughtfully designed communal spaces provide an ideal setting to enjoy these benefits. The spacious layout, featuring shared areas and outdoor spaces, creates a welcoming atmosphere for both employees and their furry companions. Emma Hendry, JLL Consulting's People Experience Managing Director, highlights this advantage:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;Being dog-friendly offers companies a big opportunity to engage employees and potentially boost that days-per-week average&quot; <a href="https://www.jll.ca/en/trends-and-insights/workplace/why-more-companies-are-opening-office-doors-to-dogs" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Dog-friendly policies contribute to a better workplace culture by:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Boosting productivity, as supported by research from Virginia Commonwealth University <a href="https://community.thriveglobal.com/proven-benefits-dog-friendly-office/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
                <li>Increasing employee engagement and retention</li>
                <li>Strengthening team bonds and improving office morale</li>
                <li>Encouraging more frequent breaks and physical activity during the day <a href="https://community.thriveglobal.com/proven-benefits-dog-friendly-office/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[3]</sup></a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Operations analyst Izzy O'Connor sums up the appeal of such workplaces:</p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>&quot;It one hundred percent without a doubt gives me an incentive to come to work&quot; <a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/partner/30-01-2020/canine-to-five-why-every-office-should-be-a-dog-office" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>To fully realize the benefits of pet-friendly policies, organizations need to implement them thoughtfully. This includes setting clear guidelines, creating designated areas for pets, and addressing the needs of all employees, including those with allergies or sensitivities. With careful planning, dog-friendly offices can enhance productivity, foster stronger connections, and improve overall wellbeing, making the workplace a more enjoyable and cohesive environment for everyone.</p>
